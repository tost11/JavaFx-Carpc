## How to use

## Setup

### JavaFx-Carpc
Clone and repository and build project
replace or define $PATH_TO_FX with your installation path of javafx
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tost11/JavaFx-Carpc.git
cd JavaFx-Carpc/
git submodule update --init --recursive
mkdir build
javac --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls -d build -sourcepath 'src/main/java/:json-simple/src/main/java/:java-mpd/src/main/java/' src/main/java/de/tostsoft/carpc/PlayerMain.java
cd build
echo "Main-Class: de.tostsoft.carpc.PlayerMain" > manifest.txt
echo "Class-Path: ." >> manifest.txt
jar -cvfm Player.jar manifest.txt
```
After that switch int to build folder and Start the Application.
```bash
java -jar --module-path $PATH_TO_FX --add-modules javafx.controls build/Player.jar
```
Whenn connected via ssh you need to export display via 'export DISPLAY=:0'

### MPD
MPD is a musik Player that can be controllerd by a text interface over Network. So it is possible to control the musik played on your Car-Radio by Handy, PC, or whatever device you are using.
The recomended MPD version is 0.21.*. On previous versions download of album covers via text interface will not work and it will not be shown in the Player.

#### Setup on Raspian Buster
Just install mpd from you packet manager an you're fine

#### Setup on Raspian Stretch
First of all you don't want to do that !!!
Are you still here ?
Mhm ok...
Do you realy need the album covers? if not install last version from packet manager and be happy.
If not you have to compile mpd yourself and that means you need an newer version of: gcc, cmake, boost, pyhton, meson, ninja.
For that have a look at the Scripts in the [setup_data/scripts/raspian_stretch] folder. That will keep your pi busy for a howl day. For faster compiling you cann disable pyhton tests. Also you have to increase the virtual RAM of the rpy for compiling gcc. I changed it one 1GB and it worked fine.

#### Configuration
For starting mpd with the pi user you have to crate an .mpd folder in /home/pi and copy the default config file from /etc/mpd.conf. After that you change or may not change these Paramters.

- music_directory         "home/pi/owncloud"
- playlist_directory      "/home/pi/owncloud/Playlists-Musikbot"
- user                    "pi"
- bind_to_address         "0.0.0.0"
- db_file                 "/home/pi/mpd/tag_cache"
- log_file                "/home/pi/.mpd/mpd.log"
- pid_file                "/home/pi/.mpd/pid"
- state_file              "/home/pi/.mpd/state"

Also i prefer changing audio output to pulse instead of alsa

### Feature Owncloud
With this feature you cann download music data from a your own server. There fore you have to define the url and the destination folder in the config file as discribed beneth. Also you have to install the [owncloud-cmd](https://doc.owncloud.com/desktop/advanced_usage/command_line_client.html) and define user and password in a .netrc described [here](https://man.cx/netrc(4)). Also you have to define an empty exlude list file.
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y owncloud-client-cmd
sudo mkdir /etc/owncloud-client
sudo touch /etc/owncloud-client/sync-exclude.lst
```

### Feature Gps-Logging/Upload
To use gpsd and Log all informatin to json files the libraries *gpsd* and *gpsd-clients* are needet so install them
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y gpsd gpsd-clients
```
With *gpsd-clients* comes a comandline tool named: *gpspipe* that will log all outcoming trafic from gpsd to a specified json file.
For use of that i crated a script that stores these output in a specified folder with the current time. Have a look [here]().
At least make that script executable and add it to your crontab entry to start on boot
```bash
@reboot /bin/bash PATH_TO_SCRIPT PATH_TO_LOG_FOLDER
```

Set the config variable *gps_dir* int the application configuration to match the same folder


### Feature Navit
For navigation is the Software [Navit](https://www.navit-project.org) used.
You cann install it via package manager or build it yourself.
On my rpy3, I needet to to build it manually for Raspian Stretch for some reason (check scritps folder for that).
Navit loads all important information from navit.xml. You can check out mine [here](/setup_data/navit/nativ.xml).
Most of it comes from [this side](http://ozzmaker.com/navigating-navit-raspberry-pi)
Its also a very good tutorial how to get navit running.

If navit sometimes freezes for no reason you have to increase the gpu RAM fo the Raspberry-Pi. Therefor open /boot/config.txt and change gpu_mem e.g. gpu_mem=128.

When using my navit.xml you cann install it via:
```bash 
sudo apt-get -y install navit mpc
cp JavaFx-Carpc/setup_data/navit/navit.xml ~/.navit/
cp JavaFx-Carpc/setup_data/scripts/change_bright.sh ~/.navit/
chmod u+x ~/.navit/change_bright.sh
sudo cp JavaFx-Carpc/setup_data/navit/icons/* /usr/share/navit/icons/
sudo mkdir /usr/share/navit/maps/
sudo wget -O /usr/share/navit/maps/map.bin http://maps9.navit-project.org/api/map/?bbox=-17.6,34.5,42.9,70.9
```
This will create local .navit folder in your houme directory where all data ist stored. Also it installs mpc for the mpd controll buttons in navit UI. And it will download a map containg Westeurope.

### Feature DAB+ via Welli-IO
For using the DAB+ Feature you have to compile welle-io yourself and add start script to boot process. Also you have to enable feature via config paramters.
```bash
sudo apt-get install -y cmake libmp3lame-dev libmpg123-dev libfftw3-dev libfaad-dev librtlsdr-dev
git clone https://github.com/AlbrechtL/welle.io.git
cd welle.io/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DRTLSDR=1 -DBUILD_WELLE_IO=OFF -DBUILD_WELLE_CLI=ON
make -j4
sudo make install
#copy 'welle-cli -c 5C -C 1 -w 7979 &' to rc.local
#enable in carpc config.properties 'enable_radio=true'
```
Depending on your country you have to replace the -c paramter '5C' with the one for your location
